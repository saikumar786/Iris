# Iris Classification
Classifying Iris flower whether it belongs to one of its species(Setosa, Versi-color, Virginica)

Taken the famous and well-known dataset named Iris

This dataset is having 4 Features(sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width) and 1 Target variable(species)

We need to create a ML model which can predict whether the features of a flower we are providing belongs to the species
mentioned in the data
    We are having 3 species in our data
      1. Setosa
      2. Versi-color
      3. Virginica
      
      
I have built 2 models for predicting to which species a flower belongs to, based on given features.

  Model 1: KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors)
           This model which I have built predicted with 97.77 % Accuracy
           
  Model 2: Logistic Regression
           This model also predicted with 97.77 % Accuracy as KNN
